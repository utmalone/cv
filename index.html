  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>Even though my title sits at entry level developer, I have in-fact been developing complex personal websites for the past 10 years. I have a very diverse portfolio filled with custom front-end and back-end developments. Due to Covid I have been
    furloughed from my previous position as a flight attendant and have now decided to put forth all of my energy towards a career field that was within reach of my previous experiences. I have a few sites that are currently being used by friends and
    collegues that I built them from scratch. I recently have also started to encorporate my vast knowledge of front and back-end practices into Wordpress. Languages I would consider myself to be an expert in are HTML, CSS, and JS. Below are links to
    a few of my websites.</p>
